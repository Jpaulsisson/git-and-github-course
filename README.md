# git-and-github-course
Colt Steele Udemy course covering Git/GitHub in depth. This is a practice repo for learning to navigate each.

I would **highly recommend** this course if you find yourself struggling with some of the inner workings of Git and GitHub. He really has done an incredible job of explaining this and making it easier to understand.
